## ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Ownership

Google will ask you to verify that you own the domain. Here are the available methods:

### Method 1: DNS Verification (Recommended for Cloudflare Pages)

1. Google will provide you with a **TXT record**
   - Example: `google-site-verification=ABC123XYZ...`

2. **Add this to your Cloudflare DNS**:
   - Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
   - Select your domain
   - Navigate to **DNS** ‚Üí **Records**
   - Click **Add record**
   - **Type**: TXT

### Method 2: HTML Tag Verification

1. Google will provide you with a meta tag:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="ABC123XYZ..." />
   ```

2. **Add this to your environment variables in Cloudflare**:
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
   - Add: `GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` = `ABC123XYZ...` (just the content value)
   - **Save and Deploy**

3. The verification tag is already integrated in your `layout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   verification: {
     google: process.env.GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION || '',
   }
   ```

4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Return to Google Search Console and click **Verify**

## üîç Step 5: Request Indexing for Key Pages

To speed up the indexing process, manually request indexing for important pages:

1. In Google Search Console, use the **URL Inspection** tool (top search bar)
2. Enter your key URLs one by one:
   ```
   https://thomas-nicoli.com/en
   https://thomas-nicoli.com/es
   https://thomas-nicoli.com/en/services
   https://thomas-nicoli.com/es/services
   https://thomas-nicoli.com/en/contact
   https://thomas-nicoli.com/es/contact
   ```
3. For each URL:
   - Click **Request Indexing**
   - Wait for confirmation (may take a few minutes per URL)

> **Note**: You can only request indexing for ~10-15 URLs per day due to Google's quota limits.
