## ‚¨ú Phase 2: ElevenLabs Configuration (YOUR TASKS)

### Step 1: Create Client Tool in ElevenLabs Dashboard
1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai/agents/jrtHx9K8suqXV9kyjlb6
2. Navigate to: **Tools** ‚Üí **Client Tools** ‚Üí **Add Client Tool**
3. Fill in the following:

**Tool Name:** (MUST be exact)
```
initiatePhoneCall
```

**Tool Description:**
```
Initiates an outbound phone call to the user. Use this when the user asks to be called or wants to speak over the phone. The call will be made from our Twilio number to connect with our team.
```

**Parameters Schema:**
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "phoneNumber": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The phone number to call (in E.164 format, e.g., +15551234567)"
    }
  },
  "required": ["phoneNumber"]
}
```

4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Update Agent Prompt (Optional but Recommended)
Add this to your agent's system prompt:

```
When users want to discuss projects in detail or prefer a phone conversation, you can offer to initiate a call. Use the initiatePhoneCall tool when:
- User explicitly asks to be called
- User wants to discuss complex project requirements  
- User prefers voice communication over text chat

Before initiating a call:
1. Confirm the user's phone number
2. Let them know the call will come from +1 (478) 500-2626
3. Explain that you're connecting them with the team

Example:
User: "Can you call me?"
Agent: "I'd be happy to initiate a call! What's the best number to reach you at?"
User: "+1 234 567 8900"
Agent: "Perfect! I'll have our team call you at +1 234 567 8900 from +1 (478) 500-2626. You should receive the call within a minute."
```

## ‚¨ú Phase 3: Environment Variables Setup

### On Cloudflare Pages Dashboard

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Navigate to: **Workers & Pages** ‚Üí **thomas-nicoli** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
3. Add the following variables for **Production**:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+14785002626
TARGET_PHONE_NUMBER=+15074161239
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=thomas-nicoli.com
```

4. Click **Save** (deployment will trigger automatically)
