# UX Improvements Summary - October 2025

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. 📱 **Mobile Video Modal Fix**
**File**: `src/components/ui/hero-video-dialog.tsx`

**Problem**: On mobile, when clicking the video explainer, users had to scroll up to see the video playing.

**Solution**: 
- Added `overflow-y-auto` to the modal overlay
- Changed video container to use `my-auto` for vertical centering
- Added `onClick` stop propagation to prevent closing when clicking video
- Added padding for mobile (`p-4`) and desktop (`md:p-0`)

**Result**: Video now stays fixed center of viewport on all screen sizes, no scrolling needed! 📺
